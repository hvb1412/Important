## üöÄ Advanced Features Implemented
* Page displaying **the list of forum members**.
* Ability to **edit user profile information (name, address, bio)**.
* Clear distinction between **published posts** and **drafts**.
* Automatic **redirection** after publishing or saving a post, with **toast notifications**.
* **Pagination system** for posts.
* Ability to **access posts by category**.
* **Featured posts auto-update** on the homepage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Issues & Solutions
**Issue**: Incorrect redirection after publishing/saving a post
*Solution*: Used useNavigate() from React Router for proper navigation after each action, and updated the UI state to reflect changes.

**Issue**: Comments not appearing immediately after submission
*Solution*: Added logic to re-fetch comment data after successful submission. Used useEffect or state updates to trigger a re-render of the comment list.

**Issue**: Profile information not updating after editing
*Solution*: After a successful API update, refreshed the local state or re-fetched user data to display the latest info in the UI.

**Issue**: Search results were inaccurate (due to Markdown formatting or keyword mismatch)
*Solution*: Improved the search algorithm by stripping Markdown formatting, converting content and keywords to lowercase, and matching both title and body content.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
* **No like/vote system** for posts and comments yet.
* **No notification system** for replies or new comments.
* **Single-level comment** replies only (no nested threading).
* **No admin** panel for post moderation.
* Users cannot **embed images** or **use advanced formatting** in posts.

## üå± Future Development Plans
* Add **a like/dislike system** for posts and comments.
* **Integrate Markdown preview**, with support for **image embedding** and **rich formatting**.
* Build **a notification system** for user interactions (e.g., someone comments on your post).
* Add **an admin dashboard** for approving posts and managing user violations.
* Improve **role-based access control**: clearly separate admin, moderator, and regular user.
* **Enhance mobile UI** and improve accessibility.
